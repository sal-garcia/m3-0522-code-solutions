if the path in the app.jsx is equals to user can sign up or sign in then the auth component will be rendered
and the server will run the post method in the sign up route only if the route is a sign up route
but if its a sing in route the server will run the post method in the sign in route
if the user can stay signed in even if they refresh the page then the redirect.jsx component will be rendered
will run and it will redirect them to the same page because the url will  be replaced by the same value
if the user is true which it should be if the user is logged in
if the user wants to sign out then the handleClickSignOut method will run from the app.jsx once
the user clicks the sign out button in the navbar component
